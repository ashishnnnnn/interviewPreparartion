-> So Event bubbling is the defaults process which happens when we press (Generate any event). So bubble goes from bottom to top
and make sure if any event listner attached to parent then that will also be executed.

-> Now the the third argaument of event listners is by defaults false, which means event trickling doesn't happen by default.

-> Event trickling is opposite of event bubbling, here the event will be come from top to bottom.
