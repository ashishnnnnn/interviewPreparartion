```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(Array.prototype);
console.log(arr.__proto__);
```

-> Whenever we create some array or object or function javascript attached an object to our element create which is nothing but prototype.

-> Whenever we create an array or object we get some property attched with it , But we haven't defined that so that property is called prototype.

-> so this arr.\_\_proto\_\_ is the object which have all the property stored which we apply on array.

-> Array.prototype is same as arr.\_\_proto\_\_

-> Now arr.\_\_proto\_\_ has also an prototype which we can access by arr.\_\_proto\_\_.\_\_proto\_\_

-> And this goes on at last the prototype of the last object will be null.

```js
let obj = {
  name: "Ashish",
  city: "Arrah",
  greet: function () {
    console.log("Hello", this.name, "from", this.city);
  },
};

let obj1 = {
  name: "Adithya",
};

obj1.__proto__ = obj;

obj1.city; //Arrah

obj1.greet(); // Hello Aditya From Arrah
```

-> So here we can see that obj1 can access the property and method of obj , so this is nothing but prototypal inherticance.
