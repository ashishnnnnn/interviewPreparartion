# React Fragments

- When we use more than one element in any component we have to enclose them all in a parent element. As one component can not have more than one Parent element.

- But when we try to enclose all those element in a single parent component, there is an unnecessary element Insertion.

- To deal with That We use **React.Fragment** - This Won't insert an unnecessary dom element.
