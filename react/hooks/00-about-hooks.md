-> Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes

-> Two Rools for Hooks

-- 1. Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

-- 2. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.
