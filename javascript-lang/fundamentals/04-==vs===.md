# == vs ===
In JavaScript, == and === are both comparison operators, but they work differently:

**== (Loose Equality):**

- Compares values for equality after converting both values to a common type (type coercion).
- If the values are of different types, JavaScript attempts to convert them to the same type before making the comparison.
- This can sometimes lead to unexpected results because of the type conversion.

**=== (Strict Equality):**

- Compares both value and type.
- No type conversion is done, meaning both the type and value must be the same for === to return true.
- This is generally the safer and more predictable choice for equality checks.

1. Comparing different types:
```
0 == "0";  // true because "0" is converted to 0
0 === "0"; // false because types are different (number vs. string)
```

2. Comparing with null and undefined:
```
null == undefined;  // true because both are considered "empty" values
null === undefined; // false because types are different (null vs. undefined)
```

3. Comparing booleans with numbers:
```
1 == true;  // true because true is converted to 1
1 === true; // false because types are different (number vs. boolean)
```

4. Comparing empty strings with numbers:
```
0 == "";   // true because "" is converted to 0
0 === "";  // false because types are different (number vs. string)
```
